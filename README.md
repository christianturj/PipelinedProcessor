**In our Digital Systems lab we built a basic single-cycle CPU, however because the entire datapath had to settle within one clock edge the instruction throughput was very limited.**

**To improve performance I redesigned the processor using the classic 5 stage pipeline. The pipeline breaks the datapath into five short stages, allowing multiple instructions to run in parallel. This both improves instruction performance, and saves resources.**

> Overall this increased peformance by roughly **30 %**, while using around **77 %** less resources (LUTs). Check out the performance and documentation report for the full analysis.

*For the demo a small divider slows the 25 MHz board clock to ~1 Hz so you can watch the PC tick up on the Go-Boardâ€™s dual 7-segment display.*

The FPGA used is the LATTICE iCE40HX1K VQ100, on the GoBoard from nandland.com 
The constraint files are taken from nandland.com for the synthesis and P&R of the board:
